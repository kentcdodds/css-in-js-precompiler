## The problem

You love the benefits of CSS-in-JS, but don't love some of the performance
characteristics and trade-offs you have to make with regards to not using actual
CSS files.

## This solution

This module takes in your source code and gives you back the source code with
the literal CSS-in-JS objects swapped for class names as well as the generated
CSS. You can then use that to create a css file and deploy that.

**It's still pretty early stages**

## Installation

<!--
WHEN IT'S RELEASED WE CAN COMMENT THIS BACK IN.
This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```
npm install --save-dev css-in-js-precompiler
```
-->

This is not yet published. But you can install it anyway with:

```
npm install kentcdodds/css-in-js-precompiler
cd node_modules/css-in-js-precompiler
npm install
npm start build
```

And you should be able to use it now :)

## Usage

This is still under development so the API and assumptions are going to change.
But right now, we're na√Øvely assuming you're using `glamorous`. _But this
solution will be modified to work with **any** CSS-in-JS library you're using_.

```javascript
const precompileCSSInJS = require('css-in-js-precompiler')
const options = {
  sources: [
    {
      code: `import glamorous from 'glamorous';\nglamorous.div({fontSize: 23})`,
      filename: '/some/path.js',
      babelOptions: {/* optional. Shallowly merges with the default babelOptions */}
    },
  ],
}

const result = precompileCSSInJS(options)
result.transformed[0].code === `import glamorous from 'glamorous';\nglamorous.div("css-my79es");`
result.transformed[0].map === '<the code source map>'
result.css === '.css-my79es,[data-css-my79es]{font-size:23px;}'
```

### options

#### `sources`

This is an array of `SourceObjects` which will be used to determine what source
to precompile and how. Here are the available properties on these objects:

#### code

This is the source code to actually precompile. If this is not provided, then
the code will be derived from the `filename`.

##### filename

This is a string path to the filename. If the `code` is not provided, this will
be used to read the file. If this is not provided, then you will be unable to
handle importing dynamic values from other files.

#### babelOptions

This is the same thing you would pass to `babel.transform` if you were calling
it yourself. Read more [here](http://babeljs.io/docs/core-packages/#options).
This will be shallowly merged with the default `babelOptions`. Currently
(2017-05-03) the default babelOptions are:

```javascript
{
  babelrc: false,
  sourceMaps: true,
  plugins: [/* our custom plugin to do this extraction */],
  parserOpts: {plugins: [/* all of them except estree */]},
}
```

This is shallowly merged, with the exception of `plugins`. You can specify any
plugins you want and we'll make sure we always include our own plugin to do
the precompiling. (You're welcome).

## Inspiration

I started thinking about this around [here][inspiration-link].
